# LSP-Top Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive evaluation, vision, and implementation plans for transforming `lsp-top` from a basic LSP wrapper into a powerful command-line IDE that enables developers and AI agents to understand, navigate, and refactor TypeScript codebases without a traditional editor.

  - Next steps and action items

### 6. [Use Cases](./use-cases.md)
- **Purpose**: Real-world scenarios demonstrating the value of `lsp-top`
- **Contents**:
  - Human developer scenarios (SSH, code review, exploration)
  - AI agent integration patterns with code examples
  - Git hooks and CI/CD integration
  - Editor integration examples
  - Benefits for both humans and AI agents
  - Real-world problem-solving scenarios

## Key Insights

### Current State
The current `lsp-top` implementation has:
- ✅ **Good infrastructure**: Daemon, LSP client, CLI framework
- ✅ **Basic features**: Inspect, edit apply/plan, single navigation command
- ❌ **Critical gaps**: Limited navigation, no code understanding, poor output

### Critical Missing Features
1. **Navigation**: Only `definition` exists; need refs, type, impl, symbols
2. **Understanding**: No hover, signature help, or documentation access
3. **Refactoring**: No rename, extract, or code actions
4. **Output**: Poor formatting, no context or previews

### The Vision
Transform `lsp-top` into the "grep for code understanding":
- **For Humans**: IDE intelligence from the command line with readable output
- **For AI Agents**: Structured JSON output for automation
- **Design Philosophy**: Simple, composable commands that complete tasks efficiently
- **Use Cases**: Remote development, CI/CD, code analysis, automated refactoring

### Implementation Priorities

#### Phase 1: Core Navigation (Weeks 1-2) - CRITICAL
- Implement missing jump commands (type, refs, impl, symbols)
- Add context-aware output formatting
- Enable basic code navigation from command line

#### Phase 2: Code Understanding (Weeks 3-4) - HIGH
- Add hover information with type and documentation
- Implement signature help and document outline
- Provide rich information without opening files

#### Phase 3: Refactoring (Weeks 5-6) - HIGH
- Implement rename command with preview
- Add code actions support
- Enable safe code transformations

#### Phase 4-6: Enhancement & Polish (Weeks 7-10)
- Analysis tools (unused code, complexity)
- Search capabilities
- Command structure refactor
- Performance optimizations

## Success Criteria

### Functionality
- Navigate any symbol in < 200ms
- Understand code without opening files
- Safely refactor across project
- Analyze code quality efficiently

### Usability
- Complete common tasks in 1-2 commands
- Output is immediately understandable
- Works seamlessly in scripts and pipes
- AI agents can use effectively

### Performance
- Navigation commands < 100ms
- Analysis commands < 500ms
- Refactoring preview < 1s
- Memory usage < 200MB

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Begin Phase 1 implementation (navigation commands)
   - Set up enhanced testing infrastructure
   - Create feature branches for each phase

2. **Communication**:
   - Update main README with roadmap
   - Create GitHub issues for each deliverable
   - Set up progress tracking

3. **Community**:
   - Gather feedback on command design
   - Find early adopters for testing
   - Document additional use cases

## Contributing

When implementing new features, please:
1. Follow the command structure outlined in the vision
2. Ensure both human-readable and JSON output
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Update documentation
